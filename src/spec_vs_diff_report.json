  "summary": "Diff adds utilities for role landing routes and intended-route persistence, updates RoleGate to store intended routes when unauthenticated, and (per file summary) introduces a PostAuthRedirect flow in App.tsx to wait for profile resolution and then route to an allowed intended path or role-based landing. One acceptance criterion appears unmet: new users without a profile are shown an access-denied state in RoleGate rather than being kept in the profile-setup gating flow.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-15",
      "requirement": "If the caller does not have a user profile (new user), the app does not redirect into role pages and instead keeps the user in the profile-setup flow (ProfileSetupDialog remains the gate).",
      "reason": "RoleGate currently renders an AccessDeniedScreen with \"Profile not found\" when there is no userProfile, which conflicts with keeping the user in the profile-setup gating flow.",
